# DIPS [Dero Improvements Proposals]

People wishing to submit DIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the discuss@dero.io mailing list. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a DIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
